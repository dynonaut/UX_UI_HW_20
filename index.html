            <p class="card-text">Our analysis of the current site uncovered many usability issues. The site was crowded and lacked an appropriate use of white space. It was hard to scan and plagued with many walls of text. There wasn‚Äôt a dedicated homepage or a footer.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Our interviewees confirmed that the issues we‚Äôd identified were in fact problems ‚Äî and also pointed out additional issues that we hadn‚Äôt come across, like broken links. Overall, a lack of informational hierarchy meant that critical information about how to support the organization was overlooked on both desktop and mobile versions of the site.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">Challenge</h1>
          <p class="lead">Inside Books Project sends thousands of books each year to people who are incarcerated in Texas. To do so, they must attract volunteers and people to donate books and funds for shipping costs. However, their current site is outdated and hard to navigate, making it harder for people to get involved.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="display-4">Solution</h1>
            <p class="lead">Our website redesign focused on establishing credibility and building a trustworthy site that showcased Inside Books Project‚Äôs point of view and the impact they‚Äôve made, while giving people a clear path to get involved.</p>

          <p class="lead">One major learning that I took away from this process was how important it was to stay in scope. There were several times where we envisioned programs for community engagement and got away from our overall task of the website redesign. We kept coming back to our user and their needs as our guiding force.</p>
            <p>For future iterations, I would like to add a page that showcases the latest news and updates, as well as integrates a feed of Inside Books Project‚Äôs latest social media posts. I also think that the book wishlist section of the site could be a larger partnership with a local retailer like BookPeople. Finally, I‚Äôd like to make the site available in other languages, especially Spanish, in order to ensure that the content appeals to a wider community of potential volunteers and donors.</p>
